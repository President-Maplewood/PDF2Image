Hello, to install this just download the py file and run it with pdf2image installed and tkinter
You also will want to create a directory in your D drive called PDF

PDF will have subdirectories DUMP and RESOURCES, put all the files labled RESOURCES on the repo inside the RESOURCES folder
DUMP will have the subdirectory 'out'
out will have the subdirectory 'ROWs'

Done.
